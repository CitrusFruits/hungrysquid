		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Hungry Squid is a hackathon project developed at <a href="https://skuid.com">Skuid</a>, originally designed to be an easter egg in the product. Since the game never made its way into the product itself, I have made it available here for anyone and everyone to enjoy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The game itself is a play on Skuid's product. In Skuid the product, dragging and dropping are a big part of the product, so I chose to make it a big part of the gameplay in Hungry Squid. The taco isn't of any particular significance, but hey, who doesn't like tacos?
		</p>
		<p>The squid, taco, and fire sprites were generously made by Tyrick Christian. The graphical tiling patterns were adapted from some open source images found online, and I apologize for not remembering where they were from or who made them. The gameplay design and development was done by me, Andrew Duensing.</p>
